### What??

So you are on Discord, using CRBT (or maybe not!) and suddenly you receive this:

![You've got mail!](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/639241740800491566/1012810862207176744/unknown.png) (or similar)

That is what we call a CRBT message!

### Why?

You may receive CRBT messages on multiple occasions, including:

- [ðŸ”—](#about-bug-reports-or-suggestions) An update on a bug report (using `/report`)
- [ðŸ”—](#about-bug-reports-or-suggestions) An update on a CRBT suggestion (using `/suggest`).
- [ðŸ”—](#about-bug-reports-or-suggestions) You got a message from the CRBT developers to your suggestion or bug report
- [ðŸ”—](#about-being-striked-from-a-discord-server) A case was added to your moderation history (banned, warned, kicked, muted) by a moderator
- [ðŸ”—](#other-occurences) Other occasions

### About bug reports or suggestions

You typically receive this type of message whenever an official CRBT developer has interacted to a suggestion or bug report you sent.

These messages appear once a suggestion or bug report was approved/fixed, denied, or reply to. The latter has an option to reply back, so you don't have to join the CRBT Discord!

If your suggestion or bug report was denied, a message may have been provided by the developer itself explaining why. You may send your issue again with the appropriate information.

If your suggestion or bug report was approved then hurray, and thanks for submitting!

### About being striked from a Discord server

This message is sent to you whenever a moderator in a server you're part of adds a case to your moderation history (i.e. warn, timeout, banned, kicked, or unbanned).

![Example: Getting warned from a server](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/639241740800491566/1012812909233049640/unknown.png)

Example: Getting warned from a server.

:::note
Please note that CRBT is never affiliated with the server, the moderator or the message you received. CRBT is only forwarding the strike to your messages, and is in no way responsible for the content of the message or the origin server, even if its a Partnered Server.
:::

### Other occurences

You may receive other kinds of messages from CRBT, including:

- ~~Broadcasted partner messages (assuming you're a CRBT Partner)~~
- ~~Updates on CRBT's news (if you've signed up for them)~~ (coming soon)
- Broadcasted CRBT Dev messages (if you've got access to CRBT Dev)
