## Welcome & Farewell messages

- Added two new commands, `/welcome` and `/farewell`
- On each command, use `message` to bring up a message builder to completely customize the message to send. Use [CRBTscript](https://crbt.app/script) to enrichen your messages with dynamic tags!
- Use `channel` to change the channel where new welcome or farewell messages should be sent.
- Use `preview` to preview how the message will look to users joining or leaving the server, and check for any errors along the way.
- To disable or re-enable them, use the `/module` command.
