# CRBT Docs

Welcome to the CRBT Docs website! In there, you'll find:

- Documentation for [CRBTscript](/crbtscript/intro), a placeholder system to allow embedding of dynamically changing values, notably in Welcome & Farewell messages.
- The [blog](/blog), where you can find changelogs about CRBT.
- More to come, like a self-hosting guide.

  {/* The documentation for Purplet, our homemade Discord bot framework and suite of tools to interact with the Discord API, can be found on [Purplet's own docs website](https://purplet.js.org). */}
</>

Thank you so much for visiting this website, and I hope you'll have a good time understanding how these more technical tools work and will help you building better communities and tools with CRBT! ❤️
