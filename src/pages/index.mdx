# CRBT Docs

Welcome to the CRBT Docs website! In there, you'll find the documentation for:

- The [CRBT API](/api/intro), a way to fetch, send and delete data from and to the [CRBT bot](https://crbt.app).
- [CRBTscript](/crbtscript/intro), a template language made for and by the CRBT Team to allow easy embedding of dynamically changing values in the CRBT bot.

The documentation for Purplet, our homemade Discord bot framework and suite of tools to interact with the Discord API, can be found on [Purplet's own docs website](https://purplet.js.org).

Thank you so much for visiting this website, and I hope you'll have a good time understanding how these more technical tools work and will help you building better communities and tools with CRBT! ❤️
