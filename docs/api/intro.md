# Introduction

Welcome to the CRBT API documentation! This place is where you'll find all of the different endpoints and resources related to the CRBT API.

This API allows anyone with a bit of coding knowledge to use CRBT's backend as a way to leverage apps utilizing features such as Economy, Moderation History, and more!

This is perfect for making bots without having to host and build a dedicated database, or making front-end user interfaces for interacting with the features [CRBT](https://crbt.app) provide, without having to invite CRBT itself once!

## Bugs

If you stumble across unexpected behavior in the API, or want to report incorrect documentation, please [open an issue](https://github.com/CRBT-Team/docs/issues).
